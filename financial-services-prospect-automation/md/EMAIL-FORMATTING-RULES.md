```
Good Example:

Hi Sarah,

I noticed your firm recently expanded to three new locations. Managing client workflows across multiple offices can get messy fast.

Curious how you're currently handling document routing and approval processes as you scale. Most firms your size are looking for ways to automate the repetitive stuff without losing the personal touch.

Worth a quick chat to see if we can help?

Best,
John
```

### **2. Natural Sentence Flow**
- Use proper capitalization
- Use periods, commas, question marks naturally
- Write like you're talking to a colleague

### **3. Paragraph Breaks**
- Separate thoughts with line breaks
- Keep each paragraph 1-3 sentences
- Don't let any paragraph get too long

---

## **✏️ Writing Style Requirements:**

### **Tone:**
- Friendly casual
- Practical experience
- Consultative approach
- **Curious** - ask questions!

### **Length:**
- **Subject Line:** 5-8 words
- **Email Body:** 4-5 sentences
- **Optional P.S.:** 1 sentence

### **Structure:**
1. **Opening:** Personalized hook (1 sentence)
2. **Middle:** Show understanding of their challenge (2-3 sentences)
3. **Close:** Curious question or soft CTA (1 sentence)

---

## **✅ GOOD Examples:**

### **Example 1:**
```
Subject: Quick question about your Chicago expansion

Hi Michael,

Saw you just opened two new offices in Chicago. Impressive growth for a firm your size.

Curious how you're managing compliance reporting across multiple locations now. Most wealth management firms hit a wall around 50 advisors when manual processes start breaking down.

Worth a quick call to share what we're seeing work for firms in your position?

Best,
John
```

### **Example 2:**
```
Subject: Automation for accounting firms

Hi Lisa,

Noticed your firm handles a lot of real estate clients. Tax season must be brutal with all those K-1s and partnership returns.

How are you currently handling document collection from clients? We've been working with a few CPA firms to automate the back-and-forth on missing documents.

Would love to show you what's possible. Quick 15-minute call work for you?

Cheers,
John
```

### **Example 3:**
```
Subject: Client onboarding question

Hi David,

Read your recent article on improving client experience. Really resonated with the point about first impressions mattering.

What's your current onboarding process like for new insurance clients? The firms we work with usually spend 4-6 hours per new client just on paperwork and data entry.

Curious if you're seeing similar numbers. Mind if I share a few ideas?

Best,
John
```

## **❌ BAD Examples (DO NOT DO THIS):**

### **Bad Example 1 (Too Many Formatting Characters):**
```
Subject: **Quick Question** About Your Expansion

Hi Michael,

I noticed you recently:
- Opened 2 new offices
- Hired 15+ advisors
- Expanded to Chicago market

*Pretty impressive growth!*

We help firms like yours automate their:
✓ Client onboarding
✓ Compliance reporting  
✓ Document management

**Worth a chat?**

Best,
John
```
❌ **Why Bad:** Uses asterisks, bullets, checkmarks, bold formatting

### **Bad Example 2 (Too Listy):**
```
Subject: 3 Ways to Improve Your Workflow

Hi Lisa,

I wanted to reach out because I think we could help with:

1. Automating document collection
2. Streamlining client communication
3. Reducing manual data entry

Most firms see these benefits:
• 40% time savings
• 90% fewer errors
• Better client experience

Let's talk!

John
```
❌ **Why Bad:** Numbered lists, bullet points, too sales-y, not conversational

---

### **Bad Example 3 (Too Many Quotes and Emojis):**
```
Subject: 🚀 Transform Your Practice

Hi David,

I saw your article on "client experience" and thought "this person gets it!"

We're helping firms move from:
"Manual processes" → "Automated workflows" 🎯
"4-6 hours/client" → "30 minutes/client" ⚡
"Stressed teams" → "Happy teams" 😊

❌ **Why Bad:** Emojis everywhere, quotation marks, arrows, sales-y language

---

## **🎯 The Golden Rule:**

**Write like you're emailing a colleague you respect.**

Not a marketing email. Not a sales pitch. Not a template.

Just a genuine, curious, professional human being reaching out to another professional who might benefit from a conversation.

## **✅ Implementation in n8n:**

These rules are enforced in **Workflow 07 - AI Personalization Agent**:

### **Location of Formatting Rules:**
- **Node:** "Prepare Email Draft Prompt"
- **Prompt Section:** "CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES"
- **AI Model:** GPT-4 (gpt-4o)
- **Temperature:** 0.8 (natural variation)
- **Max Tokens:** 700

### **Validation:**
The AI has been explicitly instructed to:
1. Never use formatting characters
2. Write in plain text paragraphs only
3. Keep tone curious and consultative
4. Make it sound human, not corporate

### **Output Format:**
All emails are saved to Supabase as plain text in the `email_draft` JSON field:
```json
{
  "subject_line": "plain text subject",
  "email_body": "plain text paragraphs with line breaks",
  "ps_line": "optional plain text PS or null",
  "approach_rationale": "why this angle was chosen",
  "best_send_time": "Tuesday 9-11am"
}
```
